Libraries used in the project
------------------

Retrofit

In this project I used the Retrofit library to integrate with google maps API.
I could have used AsyncTasks to perform this, but the use of the Retrofit library makes the development faster and it has a better performance.
In the link below you can check a comparison between Retrofit, Volley and AsyncTasks and understand why I had chosen.
